    "`nbdev` is a library that allows you to develop a python library in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), putting all your code, tests and documentation in one place. That is: you now have a true [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) environment, as envisioned by Donald Knuth back in 1983!\n",
    "\n",
    "`nbdev` makes debugging and refactor your code much easier relative to traditional programming environments. Furthermore, using nbdev promotes software engineering best practices because tests and documentation are first class citizens.  "

    "## Features of Nbdev\n",
    "\n",
    "`nbdev` provides the following tools for developers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automatically generate docs** from Jupyter notebooks.  These docs are searchable and automatically hyperlinked to appropriate documentation pages by introspecting keywords you surround in backticks.\n",
    "- Utilities to **automate the publishing of pypi and conda packages** including version number management.\n",
    "- A robust, **two-way sync between notebooks and source code**, which allow you to use your IDE for code navigation or quick edits if desired.\n",
    "- **Fine-grained control on hiding/showing cells**: you can choose to hide entire cells, just the output, or just the input.  Furthermore, you can embed cells in collapsible elements that are open or closed by default.\n",
    "- Ability to **write tests directly in notebooks** without having to learn special APIs.  These tests get executed in parallel with a single CLI command.  You can even define certain groups of tests such that you don't have to always run long-running tests. \n",
    "- Tools for **merge/conflict resolution** with notebooks in a **human readable format**.\n",
    "- **Continuous integration (CI) comes setup for you with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)** out of the box, that will run tests automatically for you.  Even if you are not familiar with CI or GitHub Actions, this starts working right away for you without any manual intervention.\n",
    "- **Integration With GitHub Pages for docs hosting**: nbdev allows you to easily host your documentation for free, using GitHub pages.\n",
    "- Create Python modules, following **best practices such as automatically defining `__all__`** ([more details](http://xion.io/post/code/python-all-wild-imports.html)) with your exported functions, classes, and variables.\n",
    "- **Math equation support** with LaTeX.\n",
    "- ... and much more!  See the [Getting Started](https://nbdev.fast.ai/#Getting-Started) section below for more information."

    "## A Motivating Example\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, lets define a class that represents a playing card, with associated docs and tests in a Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](images/att_00027.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above screenshot, we have code, tests and documentation in one context! `nbdev` renders this into searchable docs (which are optionally hosted for free on GitHub Pages).  Below is an annotated screenshot of the generated docs for further explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](images/att_00016.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above illustration is a subset of [this nbdev tutorial with a minimal example](https://nbdev.fast.ai/example.html), which uses code from [Think Python 2](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkPython2) by Allen Downey.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of annotations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The heading **Card** corresponds to the first `H1` heading in a notebook with a note block _API Details_ as the summary.\n",
    "2. `nbdev` automatically renders a Table of Contents for you.\n",
    "3. `nbdev` automatically renders the signature of your class or function as a heading.  \n",
    "4.  The cells where your code is defined will be hidden and replaced by standardized documentation of your function, showing its name, arguments, docstring, and link to the source code on github.\n",
    "5. This part of docs is rendered automatically from the docstring.\n",
    "6. The rest of the notebook is rendered as usual.  You can hide entire cells, hide only cell input or hide only output by using the [flags described on this page](https://nbdev.fast.ai/export2html.html).\n",
    "7.  nbdev supports special block quotes that render as colored boxes in the documentation.  You can read more about them [here](https://nbdev.fast.ai/export2html.html#add_jekyll_notes).  In this specific example, we are using the `Note` block quote. \n",
    "8. Words you surround in backticks will be automatically hyperlinked to the associated documentation where appropriate. This is a trivial case where `Card` class is defined immediately above, however this works across pages and modules.  We will see another example of this in later steps."
